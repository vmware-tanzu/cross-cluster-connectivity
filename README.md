# Cross-cluster Connectivity

Cross-cluster Connectivity enables a Service in one cluster to be discovered and
used by a client pod in a different cluster, while putting minimal requirements
on the clusters or their networking environment.

## Why?

There are various ways to share Kubernetes Services across clusters. Each has
its limitations, often due to assumptions made about the infrastructure network,
DNS, or tenancy model of the clusters.

This project aims to provide cross-cluster service discovery and connectivity
even when:

1. Service type:LoadBalancer is unavailable, or prohibitively expensive if used
   per-service
2. Pod and ClusterIP CIDR blocks are identical on all clusters
3. Users do not have permissions to edit public DNS records
4. Clusters do not follow the rules of [Namespace
   Sameness](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/kubernetes-sig-multicluster/jfDAMxFWlOg/9Z9O0mVpAgAJ)

## Limitations

* Cluster nodes need to be IP routable, for now
* No multi-tenancy support, yet
* No IPv6 support, yet

## Getting Started

These instructions will setup the project on a [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
cluster on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Installing
Cross-cluster Connectivity on other Kubernetes clusters is also possible, but
not currently covered in these docs.

### Prerequisites

* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) 0.7.0+
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [clusterctl](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/clusterctl/overview.html)
* [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) 1.3+
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* Docker requires at least 4GB of memory.

### Installing on Kind

1. First, we will `git clone` and `cd` into the `cross-cluster-connectivity-api`
   repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cross-cluster-connectivity-api.git
   cd cross-cluster-connectivity-api
   ```

1. Build the docker images.
   ```bash
   $ make build-images
   ```

1. Next is spinning up the environment locally on `kind`.
   ```bash
   $ make e2e-up
   ```

   After this script is complete, you will see 3 `kind` clusters:
   1. The management cluster created by [Cluster
      API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) that manages `kind` clusters.
   1. A cluster that hosts shared services. This cluster can be accessed using
      the kubeconfig file named `shared-services.kubeconfig`.
   1. A cluster that hosts workloads, which can access the shared services. This
      cluster can be accessed using the kubeconfig file named
      `workloads.kubeconfig`.

### Deploy an example shared service

There is a set of manifests within `./manifests/example/` to serve as an example
of how to deploy and export an Nginx deployment to the workload cluster.

1. Deploy [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to generate self-signed
   certificates for the Nginx deployment and wait for cert-manager to be ready.
   ```bash
   $ kubectl --kubeconfig ./shared-services.kubeconfig apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.11.0/cert-manager.yaml
   $ kubectl --kubeconfig ./shared-services.kubeconfig wait --for=condition=Available --timeout=300s apiservice v1beta1.webhook.cert-manager.io
   ```

1. Apply the `./manifests/example/certs.yaml` to create self-signed certificates
   for Nginx.
   ```bash
   $ kubectl --kubeconfig ./shared-services.kubeconfig apply -f ./manifests/example/certs.yaml
   ```

1. Apply the `./manfiests/example/nginx.yaml` to create the Nginx deployment and
   Nginx Kubernetes service.
   ```bash
   $ kubectl --kubeconfig ./shared-services.kubeconfig apply -f ./manifests/example/nginx.yaml
   ```

1. Apply the `./manifests/example/exported_http_proxy.yaml` to create a Contour
   HTTPProxy resource that has been labeled with
   `connectivity.tanzu.vmware.com/export` to declare it as an exported service.
   ```bash
   $ kubectl --kubeconfig ./shared-services.kubeconfig apply -f ./manifests/example/exported_http_proxy.yaml
   ```

1. Test connectivity to the shared service from the workload cluster.
   ```bash
   $ kubectl --kubeconfig ./workloads.kubeconfig run -it --rm --restart=Never \
      --image=curlimages/curl curl -- curl -v -k "https://nginx.xcc.test"
   ```

### Tear Down Environment

To clean up the clusters created by the `make e2e-up` command:
```bash
make e2e-down
```
