x - Apply crd in make e2e-up
x - Rename to capi-dns-controller
x - rebase
x - rename test
x - Deploy contour in make e2e-up
x - Make a deployment manifest for capi-dns-controller
x   - rbac
x - Deploy capi-dns-controller in make e2e-up
x - Use metallb in our e2e tests
    - strict ARP mode?
x - Implement controller
   x - extract objects/functions to make smaller parts and improve test coverage
   x   - perhaps each private method the Reconcile calls is public method on one or more new objects?
   x - should "writeEndpointSlicesToCluster" write to "nonMatching" clusters too?
   x - reconcile needs to remove endpoint slices (that we manage) when things (like what?) get deleted
      - gatewaydns
      - contour/envoy/lb ip
   x - reconcile needs to update endpoint slices (that we manage) when things change like:
      - lb ip address changes
  x - mgmt-cluster namespace tenancy:
    - CAPI-DNS controller only reads from Clusters in the same namespace as the
      GatewayDNS
    - CAPI-DNS controller only writes to Clusters in the same namespace as the
      GatewayDNS
x - handle delete logic for gateway dns
x - handle update logic for gateway dns
x - create "make" task to run counterfeiter (or any go generate task)
  x - consider reusing make generate for this
x - rename cluster-a-gateway to not reference the cluster. It represents all of
  the clusters in a management namespace.
x - stomp bad endpointslices
x - don't hardcode xcc.test
- fix/cleanup logging
- continue onto next cluster/endpointSlice if updating one fails
- review logs while running test/run manually to understadn timing (i.e why does the test need 60s)
- add a third cluster to prove it's not affected in e2e?

- watch clusters
- watch services
  - maybe this can trigger the gatewaydnsrecord reconcile somehow?
  - requeue? add poll event?
