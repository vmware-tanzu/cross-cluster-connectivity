# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to the project. These guidelines will
help you get started with the Cross-cluster Connectivity project.

## Running the tests

### Prerequisites

* [Golang](https://golang.org/) 1.13+
* [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo)

The majority of our tests use the [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) BDD
framework to write our tests. Any new tests written should also be written using
[Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) and
[Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega).

### Running the unit tests

To run the unit tests for the Cross-cluster Connectivity components, run the
following command:

```
make test-unit
```

## Building

When you want to build new images of the components to deploy to a Kubernetes
cluster, you can run:

```
make build-images
```

This will take any local changes and build new docker images. These images can
then be deployed into a Kind cluster by running:

```
make e2e-up
```

### Running the end-to-end tests

These tests verify the end-to-end functionality of the Cross-cluster
Connectivity components. The test creates an example exported service on the
shared-services cluster and tests connectivity to it from the workload cluster.

With the clusters created by the instructions above, run the following command:

```
make test-connectivity
```

### Add license to source files

If you are introducing any new source files, then you must add the
[license](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cross-cluster-connectivity/blob/main/hack/license.txt)
to the top of every file. This can be done automatically using:

```
make addlicense
```

## Contributor Workflow

This section describes the process for contributing a bug fix or new feature.

### Before you submit a pull request

Please raise an issue before working on any code. This helps us discuss any
proposed changes to the project before you spend your valuable time working on
it.

### Guidelines for submitting a pull request

* Have a short subject on the first line and a body. The body can be empty.
* Use the imperative mood (ie "If applied, this commit will (subject)" should
  make sense).
* Target the `main` branch in your pull request. If `main` has moved on, you may need to rebase
  and resolve any conflicts before we can merge.
* Add any test cases where they make sense.
* Update any document as applicable.
* Add license to any new source files
* Sign the CLA
